# Datasets

The Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas features multiple water-related risk datasets:

1. Baseline Annual
1. Baseline Monthly
1. Future Projections. 

## Baseline Annual

This dataset contains the main Aqueduct framework. This is the dataset that most users are interested in.

The columns (attributes or fields) in the Annual baseline results are grouped into "identifiers", "indicators" and "grouped water risk". 

### Identifiers:  
| Column Name     | Data Type | Description |
|------------------|-------------|-----|
|**string_id**|(string)| contains a unique string for each geometry. Geometries are the union of hydrological basins, provinces and groundwater aquifers. The string_id is a combination of pfaf_id-gid_1-aqid. See the description of those columns.  |
|**aq30_id**|(integer)| unique identifier in numeric format.|  
|**pfaf_id**| (integer)| six digit Pfafstetter code for the [hydrological basins](https://hydrosheds.org/page/hydrobasins).| 
|**gid_1**| (string)| identifier for sub-national units based on the [GADM](https://gadm.org/data.html) dataset. It contains the Iso A3 country code, followed by numeric values separated by underscores for each sub-national unit.|   
|**aqid**| (integer)| identifier for groundwater Aquifers based on WHYMAP.|
|**gid_0** | (string)| ISO A3 country code based on [GADM](https://gadm.org/data.html).|   
|**name_0**| (string)| National or political entity name based on [GADM](https://gadm.org/data.html).|    
|**name_1**| (string)| Sub-national or political entity name based on [GADM](https://gadm.org/data.html).|  
|**area_km2**| (double)| area of the geometry in km2 (union of sub-basin, province and groundwater aquifer).|  

### Indicators: 

For each of the 13 indicators the columns contain the indicator abbreviation plus the type {indicator}\_{type}, e.g.:  
"bws_raw" is baseline water stress, raw value. The indicator abbreviations and types are listed below.  

#### Physical risk quantity: 
| Short    | Full |
|-------------|-----|
|**bws**| Baseline water stress|  
|**bwd**| Baseline water depletion|  
|**iav**| Interannual variability|  
|**sev**| Seasonal variability|  
|**gtd**| Groundwater table decline|  
|**rfr**| Riverine flood risk|  
|**cfr**| Coastal flood risk|  
|**drr**| Drought risk|

#### Physical risk quality:
| Short    | Full |
|-------------|-----|
|**ucw**| Untreated connected wastewater|  
|**cep**| Coastal eutrophication potential|

#### Regulatory and reputational risk:
| Short    | Full |
|-------------|-----|
|**udw**| Unimproved/no drinking water|    
|**usa**| Unimproved/no sanitation|  
|**rri**| Peak RepRisk country ESG risk index|  

### Types:  
| Type   | Data Type | Description |
|------------------|-------------|-----|
|**\_raw**| (double) | raw value. Units depend on the indicator. See the technical note.|  
|**\_score**| (double) | each indicator is mapped to a [0-5] scale.|  
|**\_label**| (string) | A label explaining the category of the indicator including threshold. e.g. "Extremely High (more than 1 in 100)".|  
|**\_cat**| (integer) | integer for each category [-1,4], can be used for visuals.|  

### Grouped water risk

see the technical note for a description of aggregating the 13 indicators into sub-groups and an overall water risk score using the composite index approach. The grouped water risk scores use the follwing format:

w_awr_{weightingscheme}\_{group}\_{type}  

w_awr, stand for weighted aggregated water risk. Mainly used to keep them separate from the remaining indicators.    

e.g. w_awr_min_rrr_score is the aggregated score using the mining weighting scheme for the regulatory and reputational risk group.


#### Weighting Scheme
| Short  | Full |
|-------------|-----|
|**def**| Default | 
|**agr**| Agriculture |  
|**che**| Chemicals  |
|**con**| Construction Materials  |
|**elp**| Electric Power  |
|**fnb**| Food & Beverage  |
|**min**| Mining  |
|**ong**| Oil & Gas |  
|**smc**| Semiconductor |  
|**tex**| Textile  |

#### Groups
| Short  | Full |
|-------------|-----|
|**qan**| Physical risk quantity  |
|**qal**| Physical risk quality | 
|**rrr**| Regulatory and reputational risk |
|**tot**| Total, Overall water risk. |

#### Types

| Type   | Data Type | Description |
|------------------|-------------|-----|
|**\_raw**| (double)| raw value on 0-5 scale. Result of weighted composite approach|  
|**\_score**| (double) | score [0-5], result of applying a quantile approach to raw values. See below |  
|**\_label**| (string) | A label explaining the category of the grouped water risk.|  
|**\_cat**| (integer)| integer for each category [-1,4], can be used for visuals.|  
|**\_weight_fraction**| (double)| the fraction [0-1] of the group towards the overall water risk score. NoData is excluded from the weights and therefore the fractions can be lower than 1 depending on data availability. See the technical note for the weights per industy and indicator. |


#### Quantile linear interpolation. 
Aggregating multiple scores will change the distribution of the data. Therefore we calculate the quantiles and use linear interpolation to remap the raw values to 0-5 scores. The quantiles can be obtained from the data but are also listed below. 

| percentile | score | quantity | quality | regulatory and reputational | overall |
|------------|-------|----------|---------|-----------------------------|---------|
| 0          | 0     | 0.00     | 0.00    | 0.00                        | 0.00    |
| 0.2        | 1     | 0.72     | 1.45    | 0.30                        | 1.01    |
| 0.4        | 2     | 1.09     | 2.20    | 1.39                        | 1.61    |

| 0.8        | 4     | 2.34     | 3.83    | 3.93                        | 2.68    |
| 1          | 5     | 5.00     | 5.00    | 5.00                        | 5.00    |

The columns (attributes or fields) in the future projections results are grouped into "identifiers" and "indicators". [Methodology document](https://www.wri.org/publication/aqueduct-water-stress-projections-decadal-projections-water-supply-and-demand-using)

## Indicators  
There are four indicators, three target years, three scenarios, three data types.  	

The indicators use the following format:  
{II}{YY}{SS}{T}{X}	 

II,	indicator code  
YY,	year code   
SS, scenario code    
T, data type code    
X, suffix    

### {II}	Indicator codes  
ws	water stress  
sv	seasonal variability  
ut	water demand  
bt	water supply  
	
### {YY}	Year codes  
20	2020  
30	2030  
40	2040  
	
### {SS}	Scenario codes  
24	ssp2 rcp45 (optimistic)  
28	ssp2 rcp85 (business as usual)  
38	ssp3 rcp85 (pessimistic)  
	
### {T}	Data types  
c	change from baseline  
t	future value  
u	uncertainty value (available for seasonal variablity and water supply)
	
### {X}	Suffixes  
l	label string  
r	raw value  

### Units 
Units depend on the combination of tha above options. Units are [m/y] for ut, bt future value and dimensionless for ws and sv respectively. Other units are self-explanatory.   
	
For example the layer {ws4028cl} is "projected change in water stress by the year 2040 under a business as usual (ssp2 rcp85) scenario"	 


## Extra columns for Location Analyzer

# How to use  
Aqueduct 3.0 is available in various GIS data formats. The entire database comes in a zipped folder. Unzip the folder first. 
For QGIS, simply open the QGIS project files (.qgz). For use of the data in ArcMap, simply click the project files(.mxd) files and the data and styles should load correctly.

For other programs we recommend opening the GeoPackage (.gpkg) and shapefiles (.shp). 

The baseline data is not available in shapefile format because the number of columns exceeds the maximum of this format.

We also provide tabular data (without the geometry) in Excel (.csv UTF-8) format. 

Supported:  
ArcMap 10.x and above  
QGIS 3.4.x and above
